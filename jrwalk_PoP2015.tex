\begin{abstract}
I-mode is a novel high-confinement tokamak regime characterized by H-mode-like enhanced energy confinement and the formation of a strong temperature pedestal, without the accompanying density pedestal or enhanced particle confinement, maintaining an L-mode-like density profile.  I-mode exhibits a number of desirable properties for a reactor regime, including a lack of strong degradation of energy confinement with heating power and apparent naturally-occurring suppression of large ELMs, avoiding the need for externally-applied ELM suppression.  However, under certain conditions (particularly, reduced toroidal field) small, intermittent ELM-like events are seen, although these cases are modeled to be stable to the peeling-ballooning MHD instability associated with the ELM trigger, as is typical of I-mode pedestals.
